                Participants are allowed to join as a team consisting of a maximum of 4 people and a minimum of 2 people. Don't have a team? Don't worry! There will be a team-forming session on the first day of the Hackathon. You are required to bring a laptop and any device that you need. We will provide you with a designated sleeping area and food during the hackathon, however, you need to bring your own sleeping bag and toiletries.</p>
